JSONView-for-Chrome CSV Fork
===================

This is a fork of the JSONView extension that adds support for
downloading the JSON contents as a CSV file.

Unfortunately, it also means bundling and loading all of JQuery and
all of JQuery-CSV, which are not the smallest files.

Original project here: https://github.com/gildas-lormeau/JSONView-for-Chrome
